        <h1>Basics on using React16+</h1>
        <p>
            Since 2019, react made a big change in how to code in the framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important changes are functional components, hooks, context and how functional programming and scalable patterns are reinforced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roots believes that these changes help developers in the end run, and we want you to use them at top level.
        </p>
        <p>
            All our codebase is made using funtional components when posible, also context for store management. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope this starter also works as a reference in using hooks and context.
